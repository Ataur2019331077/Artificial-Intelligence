# Maze Solving Algorithms

In this document, we explore four popular search algorithms for solving mazes: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), and A* Search.

## Maze Problem Description

A maze is a grid of cells, where some cells are blocked (walls), and others are open (passageways). The objective is to find a path from a specified start cell to a designated end cell while avoiding the walls.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. Here's how DFS works in the context of solving mazes:

- Start at the beginning cell.
- Explore the first available unvisited neighboring cell.
- Continue exploring deeper until reaching the end or a dead-end.
- Backtrack if reaching a dead-end and continue exploring other unvisited paths.
- Repeat until the end cell is reached or all paths are exhausted.

DFS does not guarantee the shortest path.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is another uninformed search algorithm that explores all neighboring cells at the current depth level before moving deeper. In the context of mazes:

- Start at the beginning cell.
- Explore all available unvisited neighboring cells at the current level.
- Move to the next level and repeat the process.
- Continue until the end cell is reached.

BFS guarantees the shortest path.

## Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

GBFS is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the distance to the goal from each cell. In the context of mazes:

- Start at the beginning cell.
- Choose the neighboring cell that appears closest to the end cell according to the heuristic.
- Repeat until the end cell is reached.

GBFS may not always find the optimal path but is often more efficient in terms of memory than BFS.

## A* Search

A* is an informed search algorithm that combines the best aspects of **BFS** and **GBFS**. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from the start to the end through each cell. In the context of mazes:

- Start at the beginning cell.
- Calculate a cost function for each neighboring cell, combining the cost to reach that cell from the start and the heuristic estimate to the end.
- Choose the cell with the lowest cost.
- Repeat until the end cell is reached.

A* guarantees the shortest path and is often more efficient than BFS in practice.

## Conclusion

Each of these maze-solving algorithms has its strengths and weaknesses. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the maze's size, complexity, and the need for an optimal or fast solution. Experiment with these algorithms to find the best fit for your specific maze-solving problem.
